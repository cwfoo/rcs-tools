# rcstag
Similar to `rcsfreeze`, but only files in the working directory (i.e. checked
out files) are given new symbolic names. Useful for managing multi-file projects
where some files are renamed or no longer needed ("deleted").

The idea is to run `rcstag` each time there is a new revision in any of the
files in the directory.


## Credits
`rcstag` is modified from `rcsfreeze` obtained from RCS 5.10.0 (released:
