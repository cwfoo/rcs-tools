# RCS tools
Additional scripts for RCS (Revision Control System).


## Scripts
### `rcsamend`
Edit an RCS log message in a text editor. This is a user-friendly alternative to
`rcs -m...`. Inspired by `git commit --amend ...`.

### `rcstag`
Similar to `rcsfreeze`, but only files in the working directory (i.e. checked
out files) are given new symbolic names. Useful for managing multi-file projects
where some files are renamed or no longer needed ("deleted"). Inspired by
`git tag ...`.

Credits: `rcstag` is modified from `rcsfreeze` obtained from GNU RCS 5.10.0
(released: 2020-10-20).


## Installation
Copy or symbolically link the scripts into a directory on your `PATH`.
e.g. `cp rcstag ~/bin/.` or `ln -s "$(pwd)/rcstag" ~/bin/.`


## Usage
Each script has a `--help` option that prints usage information.


## License
GPLv3 or (at your option) any later version.
